This is the code and configuration for appropriateness of type and repeat prescribing.

* Raw model outputs, including charts, crosstabs, etc, are in `released_outputs/`
* If you are interested in how we defined our variables, take a look at the study definitions for [cohort definition](https://github.com/opensafely/amr-uom-brit/tree/main/analysis); these are written in `python`.
* If you are interested in how we defined our code lists, look in the [codelists folder](https://github.com/opensafely/amr-uom-brit/tree/main/codelists).
* Developers and epidemiologists interested in the framework should review [the OpenSAFELY documentation](https://docs.opensafely.org/)
