# Project: The impact of COVID -19 on antibiotic prescribing in primary care in England: evaluation and risk prediction of appropriateness of type and repeat prescribing

[View on OpenSAFELY](https://jobs.opensafely.org/university-of-manchester/brit-antibiotic-research/service_eval_work/)

Details of the purpose and any published outputs from this project can be found at the link above.


This is the code and configuration for appropriateness of type and repeat prescribing.

* Raw model outputs, including charts, crosstabs, etc, are in `released_outputs/`
* If you are interested in how we defined our variables, take a look at the study definitions for [cohort definition](https://github.com/opensafely/amr-uom-brit/tree/main/analysis); these are written in `python`.
* If you are interested in how we defined our code lists, look in the [codelists folder](https://github.com/opensafely/amr-uom-brit/tree/main/codelists).
* Developers and epidemiologists interested in the framework should review [the OpenSAFELY documentation](https://docs.opensafely.org/)
